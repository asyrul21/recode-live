# The TDEE Calculator

Based on the [Harris-Benedict Equation (Revised by Mifflin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris–Benedict_equation):

TDEE = BMR \* Physical Activity Level (PAL)

BMR formula for men:

`BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5`

BMR for women:

`BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161`

PAL:

    - Sedentary (little to no exercise + work a desk job) = 1.2

    - Lightly Active (light exercise 1-3 days / week) = 1.375

    - Moderately Active (moderate exercise 3-5 days / week) = 1.55

    - Very Active (heavy exercise 6-7 days / week) = 1.725

    - Extremely Active (very heavy exercise, hard labor job, training 2x / day) = 1.9
