# The TDEE Calculator

# Background

TDEE or Total Daily Energy Expenditure is the total amount of calories that a person needs on a daily basis. This number is crucial, especially if you are looking to losing or gaining weight.

There are a number of formulas which have been used throughout the past many years, but the one that I always use is the Harris-Benedict Equation. In addition, there are also variations to this formula. For this demonstration, we will the choose the one revised by Mifflin.

TDEE = BMR \* Physical Activity Level (PAL)

BMR or in short the Basal Metabolic Rate is the total number of energy (in calories) needed for a person to survive, but without doing anything. For example, the energy required to pump the heart, the blink your eyes, to sleep (yes, sleep consumes energy), etc.

Based on the [Harris-Benedict Equation (Revised by Mifflin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris–Benedict_equation) the BMR formulas are as follows:

For men:

`BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5`

For women:

`BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161`

Physical Activity Level is an index which indicates how active a person is in his/her daily lives.

PAL:

    - Sedentary (little to no exercise + work a desk job) = 1.2

    - Lightly Active (light exercise 1-3 days / week) = 1.375

    - Moderately Active (moderate exercise 3-5 days / week) = 1.55

    - Very Active (heavy exercise 6-7 days / week) = 1.725

    - Extremely Active (very heavy exercise, hard labor job, training 2x / day) = 1.9
